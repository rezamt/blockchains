## Quorum Overview
Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol that has been developed to provide the Financial Services Industry with a permissioned implementation of Ethereum that supports transaction and contract privacy.

Quorum includes a minimalistic fork of the Go Ethereum client (a.k.a geth), and as such, leverages the work that the Ethereum developer community has undertaken.

The primary features of Quorum, and therefore extensions over public Ethereum, are:

```
- Transaction and contract privacy
- Multiple voting-based consensus mechanisms
- Network/Peer permissions management
- Higher performance
```

Quorum currently includes the following components:

```
- Quorum Node (modified Geth Client)
- Constellation - Transaction Manager
- Constellation - Enclave
```

Whilst Quorum has been designed with Financial Services use cases in mind, its implementation is not Financial Services specific and hence is appropriate for other industries that are interested in utilizing Ethereum but require the above primary features.
